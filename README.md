# FreneticV at the SBST 2022 Tool Competition

## Abstract
FreneticV is a search-based testing tool based on an evolutionary approach that generates roads where an automated driving agent possibly fails the lane-keeping task. It uses a curvature-based road representation and, compared to its predecessor [Frenetic](https://github.com/ERATOMMSD/frenetic-sbst21), considers the validity of the generated roads. In particular, it tries to avoid generating roads with overly sharp turns, it detects self-intersecting roads, and has the capability of rotating and relocating roads so as to fit them in a given map.

## SBST 2022 CPS Competition
FreneticV participated in the [competition](https://sbst22.github.io/tools/) on testing Cyber-Physical Systems at [SBST 2022](https://sbst22.github.io/).
